  "aboutMe1": "I’ve worked as a front-end developer for 3.5 years, building various web applications using Vue.js and React. Along the way, I naturally became interested in back-end development, which motivated me to grow as a full-stack developer who can design and build projects end-to-end. Right now, I’m diving into back-end technologies like Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, and Express.js, as well as database design, to get a solid understanding of how systems work as a whole.",
  "aboutMe2": "I’m always excited to learn something new and love tackling challenges with persistence and creativity. I take pride in exploring different approaches to solving problems and staying focused until I find the best solution. Working at a startup taught me how to embrace feedback with an open mind and quickly turn it into meaningful improvements.",
  "aboutMe3": "What I enjoy most is adapting to unfamiliar technologies and making them second nature. My ultimate goal is to create products that users genuinely love and find easy to use while continuing to grow as a developer.",
